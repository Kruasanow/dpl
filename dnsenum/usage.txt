usage: DNSEnum.py domain [options]

positional arguments:
  domain                Hostname to run enumeration on

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            Display this helpful bit and exit
  -w WORDLIST, --wordlist WORDLIST
                        Specify wordlist file
  --records {NS,A,CNAME,MX} [{NS,A,CNAME,MX} ...]
                        Query for DNS records; Options are NS, A, CNAME, and MX
  -z, --zone-transfer   Attempt a zone transfer on domain (Note: this may be illegal depending on your area, make sure
                        you are authorized to perform a zone transfer on your target assets)
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Specify output file
  --json                Output results in JSON format

The only required arguments are domain, --records, and --wordlist, though I have added logging features and zone transfer capability which may be useful depending on the target surface.
